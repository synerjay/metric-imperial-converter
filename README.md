# Metric-Imperial Converter

Automatically converts metric or imperial measurements into either conversions. 

Mainly for Node/Express server management practice. 

Measurements can be either in lowercase or uppercase. The response is a JSON object showing the results of the conversion. 

Chai assertion tests were also done to ensure quality assurance of the app.
